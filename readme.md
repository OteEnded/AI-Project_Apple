# AI Project - Apple Production Forecasting

## Overview
This project is a group assignment for an AI class. The objective is to forecast apple production based on different apple types, namely Envy, Gala, and Fuji. The dataset used for this project also includes the region as a parameter. We have employed various techniques to develop the forecasting model.
